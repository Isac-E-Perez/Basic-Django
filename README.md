# Getting Started

1. Install Python from the website if you haven't yet:

        https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Being a Python Web framework, Django requires Python. Lastest version of Python 3 is recommended (I will be using Python 3.10.0 for Mac). Check your Python version before continuing in the command prompt:

        python3 --version
        
3. The next step is to install Pipenv, so you can install dependencies and manage virtual environments.
 
4. Make sure that `pip` is available on your device. You can check this by running:

       $ pip --version
       
5. You will need Homebrew for this next part if you are using a Mac. 
            
       $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"     
       
7. Use `brew` to install pyenv:  
       
       $ brew update
       $ pip install pyenv
       
6. As well as install virtualenv. virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

       $ sudo pip install virtualenv
       
7. Ensure installation by checking the version: The version I am using is `virtualenv 20.10.0`. 

       $ virtualenv --version 
       
8.

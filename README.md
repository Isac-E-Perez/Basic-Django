# Getting Started

1. Install Python from the website if you haven't yet:

        https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Being a Python Web framework, Django requires Python. Lastest version of Python 3 is recommended (I will be using Python 3.10.0 for Mac). Check your Python version before continuing in the command prompt:

        python3 --version
        
3. The next step is to install Pipenv, so you can install dependencies and manage virtual environments.
 
4. Make sure that `pip` is available on your device. You can check this by running:

       $ pip --version
       
5. Use `pip` to install Pipenv:

       $ pip install --user pipenv
       
6. As well as install virtualenv tool.

       $ sudo pip install virtualenv
       
7.
